## 3. Game Pieces

### 3.1 Standard Pieces (8 Shapes - Tetris-style)
All pieces are composed of 4-6 colored balls arranged in these configurations:

1. **I-Piece:** 4 balls in a straight line
2. **O-Piece:** 6 balls in a 2×3 rectangle
3. **T-Piece:** 4 balls in T-shape
4. **L-Piece:** 5 balls in L-shape (3 vertical + 2 horizontal base)
5. **J-Piece:** 5 balls in reverse L-shape (3 vertical + 2 horizontal base)
6. **S-Piece:** 5 balls in S-shape (2-2-1 stagger)
7. **Z-Piece:** 5 balls in Z-shape (2-2-1 stagger)
8. **Single Ball:** 1 ball

**Note:** Variable ball counts (4-6) ensure each piece shape is visually distinct even when the same color.

### 3.2 Ball Colors
- **Starting Colors (Levels 1-2):** 3 colors (Red, Green, Blue)
- **Level 3:** 4 colors (add Yellow)
- **Level 7:** 5 colors (add Magenta)
- **Level 11:** 6 colors (add Cyan)
- **Level 15:** 7 colors (add Orange)
- **Level 19+:** 8 colors (add Purple)

**Color Palette:** RGB primaries + CMY secondaries (configurable via config.json)

### 3.3 Special Ball Types

#### 3.3.1 Exploding Balls (Implemented)
- **Appearance:** Distinct visual marker (e.g., star/burst pattern)
- **Spawn Rate:** 5% per ball in piece (configurable)
- **Behavior:** When 3+ match, clears a 7×7 area centered on match
- **Explosion Pattern:**
  - All matches: 7×7 grid-aligned square centered on the matched exploding balls
  - Multiple exploding balls: Separate 7×7 explosions per position
- **Clears:** All ball types including blocking balls within the 7×7 radius
- **Scoring:** All exploded balls counted and tracked via `BALLS_CLEARED` event
- **Visual Feedback:** Gold floating text shows count of balls destroyed

#### 3.3.2 Painting Balls (Implemented)
- **Types:** 4 variants
  - Horizontal Painter (↔)
  - Vertical Painter (↕)
  - Diagonal NE Painter (↗↙) - Paints NE-SW diagonal
  - Diagonal NW Painter (↖↘) - Paints NW-SE diagonal
- **Spawn Rate:** 5% per ball in piece (configurable, independent from exploding)
- **Behavior:** When 3+ match in their designated direction, entire line changes to the painting ball's color
- **Line Definition:**
  - Horizontal: Entire row
  - Vertical: Entire column
  - Diagonal NE: Entire NE-SW diagonal line through the match (↗↙)
  - Diagonal NW: Entire NW-SE diagonal line through the match (↖↘)
- **Match Re-Finding:** After painting, grid immediately re-checks for new matches
  - Newly painted balls can create immediate matches
  - Triggers additional cascades if matches found

#### 3.3.3 Blocking Balls (Implemented)
- **Appearance:** Distinct visual (gray/black with X pattern)
- **Spawn Method:** Drop individually from center-top of board (column 7-8)
- **Player Control:** None - they fall automatically at piece drop speed
- **Spawn Rate:** 
  - Base: 0.5% chance per piece dropped (configurable)
  - Increases with difficulty and level progression
  - Not before piece 50 on difficulty 1
  - Earlier on higher difficulties (configurable thresholds)
- **Removal:** Only by being caught in explosion radius (7×7 area)
- **Cannot:** Be matched, painted, or affected by normal clears
- **Behavior:** Falls like normal ball, stacks at bottom, persists until exploded

## 4. Game Mechanics

### 4.1 Piece Movement
- **Auto-Drop:** Pieces fall at configurable speed (increases per level)
- **Ghost Piece:** Semi-transparent outline shows where piece will land when hard dropped
- **Player Controls:**
  - **Left Arrow:** Move piece left
  - **Right Arrow:** Move piece right
  - **Up Arrow:** Rotate piece clockwise 90°
  - **Down Arrow:** Hard drop (instant fall to bottom)
  - **P Key:** Pause game
  - **R Key:** Restart game

### 4.2 Collision & Stacking
- Pieces stop when they collide with:
  - Bottom of grid
  - Another ball already in the grid
- **Lock Delay:** 500ms (configurable) before piece locks into position
  - Allows player to make final adjustments
  - Timer resets if piece moves or rotates while grounded

### 4.3 Matching & Clearing

#### 4.3.1 Match Detection
- **Minimum:** 3 balls of same color
- **Directions:** Horizontal, Vertical, All 4 Diagonals (↗ ↘ ↙ ↖)
- **Timing:** Check after each piece locks AND after each cascade drop

#### 4.3.2 Cascade System
1. Piece locks → Check for matches
2. Matches clear → Balls above drop down
3. After drop completes → Check for new matches
4. Repeat until no matches found

#### 4.3.3 Special Ball Interactions
**Priority Order:**
1. Exploding balls trigger first (if matched)
2. Painting balls apply color changes
3. Standard color matches clear
4. Cascade check repeats

**Blocking Ball Rules:**
- Not affected by painting
- Not affected by standard color matches
- Only removed by explosions or reaching bottom

### 4.4 Animation Timing (Implemented)
- **Configurable delays** between:
  - Piece lock → Match detection: `matchDetectionDelay` (default: 0ms)
  - Match clear animation: `clearAnimationDuration` (default: 100ms)
  - Ball drop speed: `dropAnimationSpeed` (default: 20ms per row)
  - Drop complete → Next match check: `cascadeCheckDelay` (default: 0ms)

**Clear Animation Sequence:**
1. Flash matched balls white 3 times (alternating original color/white)
2. Each flash: `clearAnimationDuration / 6` duration
3. Display floating point text showing score earned
4. Remove balls and update grid
5. Begin gravity animation

### 4.5 Feedback & RNG Controls (Required)

#### 4.5.1 Cascade Cause-and-Effect Feedback
- When a match is detected, visually trace the matched path for 150-250ms using thin highlight lines or arrows.
- On cascade chains, briefly highlight the origin cells for each cascade level to reduce outcome opacity.
- These hints must not block input or delay gameplay; they are purely visual overlays.

#### 4.5.2 Special Interval & Next-Special Indicator
- Support a deterministic special interval system: guarantee a special ball every N pieces (configurable).
- Show a "next special" indicator in the HUD that:
  - Always shows a countdown: "Special in N" pieces.
  - Reveals the special type within the reveal window (default 2 pieces).
  - Displays an icon that matches the upcoming special type.
  - Uses the exact color that will appear in the upcoming special.
- The interval length must scale with difficulty and/or level (longer intervals at higher difficulty).
- When interval mode is enabled, random special spawns are disabled (interval-only behavior).
- Blocking balls continue to use their own spawn rules and are unaffected by the interval.
- If interval system is disabled, fall back to standard random spawn rates.

#### 4.5.3 Bag System for Piece Shapes (Optional for Specials)
- Use a piece bag that contains one of each active shape; shuffle, then deal until empty before refilling.
- Bag size must match the active shape set (include Single Ball only if enabled).
- Bag logic applies to shapes only; color selection remains independent.
- The bag must prevent immediate repeats beyond what the shuffle allows (no external repeats until the bag refills).
- Debug mode can bypass bag order for testing.
- Optional specials bag:
  - Use a smaller bag or weighted pool for special ball types to avoid long droughts/clusters.
  - If enabled, special bag is independent of the shape bag.
  - Special bag applies only to random special spawns (it does not affect interval specials).
  - Special bag is ignored when interval-only mode is enabled because random specials are disabled.
- Configuration should allow:
  - Enable/disable shape bag.
  - Define active shapes list.
  - Enable/disable special bag and set weights (if used).

#### 4.5.4 Special Spawn Smoothing (Pity Timer)
- Add a pity timer for exploding balls: if no explosions appear within X pieces, force an exploding ball in the next piece.
- Pity timer thresholds must be configurable per difficulty.
- Pity timer should not override the special interval system; it should supplement random mode only.

## 5. Scoring System

### 5.1 Base Scoring (Implemented)
- **Base Points:** 1 point per ball cleared (configurable)
- **Cascade Bonus Formula (Progressive Multipliers):**
  - Single cascade (no chain): Base points only (balls × 1)
  - 2nd cascade in chain: Progressive scoring begins
    - Level 1 balls: `count × basePoints × 1`
    - Level 2 balls: `count × basePoints × 2`
  - 3rd cascade in chain:
    - Level 1 balls: `count × basePoints × 1`
    - Level 2 balls: `count × basePoints × 2`
    - Level 3 balls: `count × basePoints × 3`
  - Formula: Each cascade level N gets balls cleared × basePoints × N
  - Example: 2x cascade with 3 balls (L1) + 5 balls (L2) = (3×1) + (5×2) = 13 points
  - Example: 3x cascade with 3 balls (L1) + 5 balls (L2) + 6 balls (L3) = (3×1) + (5×2) + (6×3) = 31 points

### 5.2 Visual Score Feedback (Implemented)
- **Floating Text System:** Color-coded feedback for different clear types
  - **Match Clears (White #FFFFFF):** Shows ball count (not points)
    - Appears at center of matched balls
    - Text: Number of balls cleared (e.g., "5")
    - Used for normal color matches
  - **Explosion Clears (Gold #FFD700):** Shows exploded ball count
    - Appears at center of all explosion positions
    - Text: Number of balls destroyed (e.g., "12")
    - Triggered when exploding balls detonate
  - **Cascade Bonuses (Blue #4080FF):** Shows cascade multiplier
    - Appears at center of game grid
    - Text: Cascade level (e.g., "2x CASCADE!", "3x CASCADE!")
    - Only shown for 2+ cascades
  - **Animation:** All text floats upward 50 pixels over 1 second, fading linearly with rgba opacity

### 5.3 Difficulty Multiplier (Implemented)
- **Difficulty 1:** 1.0x points
- **Difficulty 2:** 1.5x points
- **Difficulty 3:** 2.0x points
- **Difficulty 4:** 2.5x points
- **Difficulty 5:** 3.0x points

**Score Calculation:** `(ballCount × basePoints + cascadeBonuses) × difficultyMultiplier`

### 5.4 Score Display (Implemented)
- **Score Manager:** Singleton module tracking score via event system
  - Listens for `BALLS_CLEARED` events to accumulate ball counts per cascade level
  - Tracks `ballsPerLevel` array to support progressive cascade scoring
  - Listens for `CASCADE_COMPLETE` events (from GameEngine) to calculate and apply final score
  - Emits `SCORE_UPDATE` events for UI synchronization
  - Detailed console logging for debugging: `🎯 SCORE CALC: 8 balls, 2x cascade, L1(3×1=3) + L2(5×2=10), TOTAL=13`
- **Real-time UI Update:** Score display updates immediately after each cascade completes
- **Current Level Score:** Displayed in HUD
- **High Score:** localStorage persistence via PlayerManager

## 6. Level & Difficulty System

### 6.1 Difficulty Settings (1-5)
Each difficulty affects:
- **Drop Speed:** Faster on higher difficulties
- **Blocking Ball Frequency:** More frequent on higher difficulties
- **Blocking Ball Start:** Earlier piece counts on higher difficulties
- **Score Multiplier:** Higher on higher difficulties
- **Color Unlock Speed:** Same across all difficulties

### 6.2 Level Progression

#### 6.2.1 Game Modes (Implemented)
Four distinct game modes offer different play styles:

**CLASSIC Mode**
- Standard timed gameplay (90 seconds per level)
- No special mechanics
- Traditional progression system
- Recommended for new players

**ZEN Mode**
- No time limit - play at your own pace
- Grid fill (breach) ends the level successfully instead of game over
- Timer display hidden from HUD
- Focus on strategy and perfect clears
- Ideal for relaxed, thoughtful gameplay

**GAUNTLET Mode**
- Timed gameplay with pre-filled challenge
- Bottom 5 rows pre-filled with random orbs (including special balls)
- Random colored orbs rise from bottom every 5 seconds
- Rising orbs include special balls (exploding, painting)
- High difficulty with constant pressure
- Tests clearing speed and management skills

**RISING_TIDE Mode**
- Timed gameplay with rising threat
- Blocking orbs rise from bottom every 5 seconds
- Blocking orbs can only be removed by explosions
- Steady accumulation of obstacles
- Requires strategic use of exploding balls
- Progressive difficulty as blocking orbs accumulate

**Mode-Specific Progression:**
- Each mode tracks progression independently
- Completing Classic-1-5 does NOT unlock Zen-1-6
- Best scores stored separately per mode
- Level unlocking managed per mode
- High scores: `"MODE-difficulty-level"` format (e.g., `"ZEN-2-3"`)

#### 6.2.2 Level Duration
- **Time Limit:** 90 seconds (configurable)
- **Completion:** Survive full duration without game over

#### 6.2.3 Level Advancement
- **Success:** Timer reaches 0 (timed modes) or grid filled (ZEN mode), board clears, advance to next level
- **Failure:** Any column reaches top row = Game Over (except in ZEN mode where it's success)
- **Infinite Levels:** No final level, continues indefinitely

#### 6.2.4 Level Unlocking
- Players start at each mode's Difficulty 1, Level 1
- Completing a level unlocks it for replay within that mode
- Can select any unlocked (mode, difficulty, level) combination from menu
- Each combination tracks independent high score
- Mode selector on main screen with hover descriptions

### 6.3 Progressive Difficulty Within Levels
As level numbers increase (within same difficulty):
- Drop speed increases (configurable increment)
- Blocking ball spawn rate increases
- More colors unlock at specific levels (3, 7, 11, 15, 19)

### 6.4 Feature Unlock Schedule (Recommended)
The following progression reduces early cognitive load and introduces counters before threats. All thresholds are configurable via `config.json`.

- **Levels 1-2:** 3 colors, no special balls.
- **Levels 3-4:** Introduce horizontal painters only.
- **Levels 5-6:** Add vertical painters.
- **Levels 7-8:** Add diagonal painters
- **Levels 9-10:** Introduce bombs at low spawn rate to establish the counter.
- **Levels 11+:** Introduceng blocki balls; slightly increase bomb rate so blockers are consistently answerable.

**Color Cap Guidance:** Keep a max of 3-4 colors through roughly Level 12, then ramp to 5-6 once specials are understood. Reserve 7-8 colors for higher difficulties.

## 8. Audio & Visual Effects

### 8.1 Sound Effects (Implemented - Programmatic Web Audio API)
- **AudioManager:** Singleton managing all game audio with Web Audio API
  - **Sound Effects:**
    - Piece rotation (subtle beep)
    - Piece movement left/right (click)
    - Piece hard drop (thud)
    - Piece lock/land (clunk)
    - Match clear (escalating pitch per cascade level)
    - Explosion (bass boom)
    - Painting activation (whoosh)
    - Level complete (victory chime)
    - Game over (descending tone)
  - **Background Music:**
    - Procedurally generated ambient music loop
    - Tempo increases with difficulty level
  - **Volume Controls:**
    - Independent SFX and music volume sliders (0-100%)
    - Master mute toggle
    - Optimization: Skips audio processing entirely when volume is 0
  - **Audio Categories:**
    - SFX (one-shot sounds)
    - Music (looping background)
    - Both controlled independently

### 8.2 Visual Effects
- **Match Animation:** Balls flash/pulse before clearing
- **Explosion Animation:** Radial burst effect
- **Painting Animation:** Wave/ripple along painted line
- **Cascade Feedback:** Visual indicator for combo count
- **Blocking Ball:** Falling animation with distinct trail
### 9.1 LocalStorage Schema
```json
{
  "ballMatcher_players": {
    "Guest": {
      "name": "Guest",
      "stats": {
        "gamesPlayed": 42,

        "sfxVolume": 85
      }
    }
  },
  "ballMatcher_currentPlayer": "Guest"
}
```

**Key Format:** `"MODE-difficulty-level"` (e.g., `"CLASSIC-1-5"`, `"ZEN-2-3"`)

**Legacy Migration:** Automatically converts old `"difficulty-level"` format to `"CLASSIC-difficulty-level"` on first loadsettings": {
    "soundEnabled": true,
    "volume": 0.7
  }
}
```

  - `risingBlocks` (boolean) - Whether orbs rise periodically
  - `risingInterval` (milliseconds) - Time between rising events (default: 5000)

### 10.2 Colors
- Ball color palette (hex codes for 8 colors)
- Background colors
- UI theme colors

### 10.3 Probabilities
- Special ball spawn rates (exploding, horizontal painter, vertical painter, diagonal painter)
- Blocking ball spawn rates per difficulty/level

### 10.4 Scoring

### 11.3 Painting + Matching
- Painted balls immediately re-checked for matches
- Can trigger additional cascades

### 11.4 Blocking Balls at Bottom
- When blocking ball reaches bottom, it stays there
- Does not clear even if surrounded by matches
- Only explosions can remove them

### 11.5 Game Over Condition
- Checked when new piece spawns
- If spawn position occupied → Game Over
- If any column reaches row 0 during piece lock → Game Over

### 11.6 Level Timer
- Countdown starts when level begins
- Pauses when game is paused
- Reaching 0:00 = Level Complete (if still alive)

---

## 12. Accessibility & Polish

### 12.1 Keyboard Controls
- All game functions accessible via keyboard
- No mouse required

### 12.2 Visual Clarity
- High contrast between ball colors
- Clear visual distinction for special balls
- Grid lines visible but subtle

### 12.3 Responsive Feedback
- Immediate visual response to all controls
- Audio feedback for all player actions

### 12.4 Performance

## 15. Monetization Strategy

**Architecture Note:** Monetization is 100% client-side; no backend is required for basic operation (optional validation endpoint for token checks).

### 15.1 Advertising Integration

#### 15.1.1 Ad Placement
**Display Advertising:**
- **Provider:** Google AdSense (or alternative FOSS-friendly ad network)
- **Ad Units:**
  - **Banner Ad:** 728×90 leaderboard at top of page (desktop)
  - **Mobile Banner:** 320×50 banner at bottom (mobile)
  - **Interstitial:** Full-screen ad shown:
    - Every 3rd game over (configurable)
    - Every 5th level completion (configurable)
    - Never during active gameplay
  - **Sidebar Ad:** 300×250 medium rectangle in right sidebar (desktop only)

#### 15.1.2 Ad Display Rules
- **Frequency Caps:**
  - Maximum 1 interstitial per 5 minutes
  - No ads during active gameplay (only during menu/game-over states)
- **User Experience:**
  - Clear "Skip Ad" timer (5 seconds for interstitials)
  - Non-intrusive placement that doesn't block game controls
  - Responsive layout adjusts when ads load

#### 15.1.3 Ad-Free State
- **Trigger:** LemonSqueezy license key purchase and activation
- **Duration:** Perpetual (no expiry) unless the license key has an explicit expiry date set in LemonSqueezy
- **Storage:** `monetization_license` (JSON) and `monetization_ad_free_until` (`"license"`) in localStorage
- **Verification:** Validated against the LemonSqueezy API on activation; re-validated every 7 days on page load
- **Visual Indicator:** "Ad-Free Mode" badge in HUD when active

### 15.2 LemonSqueezy License Integration

#### 15.2.1 Purchase Button Placement
- **Primary Button:** Floating "✨ Go Ad-Free" button in top-right corner
  - Visible only when ad-free is not active
  - Links directly to LemonSqueezy store checkout page in a new tab
- **Secondary Placement:**
  - Settings menu: "Activate License Key" option to enter a purchased key
  - Settings menu: "Remove ads" link to the store

#### 15.2.2 License Key Activation Flow
1. User purchases ad-free license on the LemonSqueezy store
2. LemonSqueezy emails a license key (UUID format) to the buyer
3. User opens Settings → "Activate License Key"
4. Enters key into the activation dialog
5. Game calls `POST https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1/licenses/activate` with:
   - `license_key`: the entered key
   - `instance_name`: `"OrbFall-ChromaCrush"`
6. On success:
   - License data (key, instance ID, expiry, customer name) stored in localStorage
   - `monetization_ad_free_until` set to `"license"`
   - All ads removed immediately
   - "Go Ad-Free" button removed
   - Confirmation message shown
7. On failure: error message shown (invalid key, already activated on max instances, etc.)

**Periodic Re-validation:**
- On page load, if a stored license exists and last validation was 7+ days ago,
  the game calls `POST https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1/licenses/validate`
- If the API returns `valid: false`, ad-free state is cleared
- Network errors during re-validation do not revoke ad-free access (fail-open)

#### 15.2.3 Thank You Experience
- **Confirmation Message:** "Thank you for your support! Ads have been permanently disabled."
- **Supporter Badge:** "Ad-Free" visual indicator in the HUD
- **Special Features (Optional Future Enhancement):**
  - Custom color themes for supporters
  - Exclusive game modes
  - Priority feature requests

### 15.3 Monetization Configuration
All monetization settings configurable via `config.json`:
```json
{
  "monetization": {
    "ads": {
      "enabled": true,
      "provider": "adsense",
      "adSenseId": "ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX",
      "slotIds": {
        "banner": "XXXXXXXXXX",
        "mobileBanner": "XXXXXXXXXX",
        "interstitial": "XXXXXXXXXX",
        "sidebar": "XXXXXXXXXX"
      },
      "displayRules": {
        "interstitialFrequency": 3,
        "levelAdFrequency": 5,
        "interstitialMinInterval": 300000,
        "skipDelay": 5000
      }
    },
    "lemonsqueezy": {
      "enabled": true,
      "storeUrl": "https://gusto4tech.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/your-product-id",
      "storeId": 0,
      "productId": 0,
